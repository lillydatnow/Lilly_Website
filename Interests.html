     <H2>Hobbies</H2>
     <li>Mock Trial. I've been on the San Rafael Mock Trial Team for four years. The last three years I was the pretrial
         attorney, which means that I argued one on one with a real judge about the admissibility of evidence into a trial.
         I won the country championships the last three years and have won multiple awards for excellence.</li>
     <li>Youth Court. <A HREF=" https://www.marincourt.org/therapeutic_youth_court.htm">Youth Court</A> is a restorative alternative to
         the traditional juevenile justice system. Youth who have had run-ins with the law and have admitted responsibility can opt to be a part of this program and receive community
         service instead of more pejorative punisments, and if they complete it in a timely manner, they will have no record. Volunteers
         in this program can serve as jury members or be trained as advocates and act as a lawyer on behalf of the respondent or the community.
        </li>
     <li>Midrasha's Fire Circle. Fire Circle is a group that meets weekly around a bonfire under the open stars to discuss life's big
         questions.</li>
     <li>Theater. I've been engaged with theater on and off but have been an enthusiast my entire life. Last year, I was a part of the school's
         production of The Addam's Family and will also be in the cast of the upcoming musical.</li>
     <li>Yoga</li>
     <li>Volunteering and Activism. I've been involved with different volunteer organizations throughout high school, including being a chef for the <A HREF=" https://www.ceresproject.org/">Ceres Project</A>, an assistant for <A HREF=" https://www.halleckcreekranch.org/view.cfm/1/Homepage">Halleck Creek Equestrian Therapy</A> for the Disabled, and an algebra tutor. I also have done a number of political internships and will have worked at every level of the United States government by the end of high school. I also frequently attend marches against the inaction over climate change, have planned a walkout of my own protesting the inaction over gun violence, and overall, try to stay up to date on current events and do my part for the world.</li>
     <li>Farming and Gardening</li>
