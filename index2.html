<BODY>
    <H1>Hello!</H1>
    <P>My full name is Lillian Rose Datnow, but people usually call me Lilly unless we're feeling fancy.</P>
    <H2>Personality</H2>
    <P>Some people seem quite and shy when you first meet them and only come out of their shell as you get to know
        them better. Not me. I am outspoken and outgoing with everyone pretty much all the time. My friends would describe
        me as funny and eccentric.</P>
    <H2>Interesting Facts and Experiences</H2>
    <P>I've been to 20 states and 14 countries (15 if you count the 1 hour layover I once had in France in
        which I ran out to get a croissant and barely made it back to my flight in time). I spent a summer living
        in Cuerna Vaca, Mexico and another in Barcelona, Spain, but embarrassingly, I still do not speak Spanish.
        Some of my favorite trips have taken me to the Olympics and New York Fashion Week.</P>
    <H2>Personal Goals</H2>
    <P>Senior can be a lot of work with the pressure of college applications on top of my already heavy workload
        and busy schedule. However, as it is the last year of high school, I have made it a goal of mine to try and
        make the most of it, meaning that, at times, I should prioritize my docial life, my family, or my own whims over
        my school work.</P>
    <H2>Hobbies</H2>
    <li>Mock Trial</li>
    <li>Youth Court</li>
    <li>Midrasha's Fire Circle</li>
    <li>Theater</li>
    <li>Yoga</li>
    <li>Volunteering</li>
    <li>Farming</li>
    <H2>Family</H2>
    <dl>
        <dt>My Dogs</dt>
        <dd>I have two dogs and they are the most important people in the family. Ruffus is a two year old German
            Shepard, Pitbull mix. She will also respond to Ruff Ruff Ruffaroo, Ruffella, Ruffle, Rufflestiltskin,
            Ruffarama, Ruffadoodle, Rooroo, Ruffalo Chicken and more. Daisy is most likely a bulldog, lab mix, and she is extremely strong
            -willed and distinctive. She loves to howl/sing and use her snout to ram through closed doors. She is rather
            fat and we love her very much.</dd>
        <dt>My Mother</dt>
        <dd>My mother's name is Jackie Datnow. She owns a business called Wine & Design in downtown San Rafael on 4th
            Street where she teaches painting classes and has painting parties.</dd>
        <dt>My Father</dt>
        <dd>My father's name is Steve Datnow. He is a software engineer and started a company. I don't really
            understand his product, so we're going to move on now.</dd>
        <dt>My Sister</dt>
        <dd>My sister's name is Emily Datnow. She is five years older than me, and she just graduated from UC Santa
            Cruz as a molecular and human biology major and is going to become a Physician's Assistant.</dd>
        <dt>My Brothers</dt>
        <dd>I have two younger brothers. Martin is four years younger than me and Leo is six years younger. They both
